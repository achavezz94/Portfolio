# Portfolio 0.0.1

After trying to find the best way to study for coding interviews, I came across multiple methods. Completing coding challenges, reading books, index cards, creating project after project that never get completed... the list is long and I alwasy felt as if the progress I was making never really stuck. I'm trying something (somewhat new) that will combine all of my previous attempts for interview prepartions. Combining most of the stategies I found, and creating a portfolio. Yes, another project, but this time... it's a little different. Instead of just creating a portfolio for things I have created and accomplished. It will be a reference for things I have learned, solved, and hopefully add a couple of index cards to go back to and study with. This way I can trully say I undestand a subject and if I ever forget, I can come back and reference it. 

Cheers,

Alexis Chavez
